Nearly two hours in and all I've managed to do is get the 1st section of HTML done and the header of .css done. Definitely realizing that I'm super slow at this still. I'm finding myself poking around until I get the right results, but knowing more of the options that are available to me. I also used a previous lesson style sheet and index page to help guide the layout of this. Something I will likely do a good bit until I get the hang of all of the elements required.

Good lord. I gpt the entire first section complete and inline. The hardest part was figuring out how to get the image to go to the right of the text rather than under it. Changing the subheader flex-direction from column to row solved the issue.

Well hell. I did it. I'm actually stoked. I definitely was pulling resources from the web but with nothing to fall back on as an absolute answer, I certainly feel proud of myself for completing the challenge! And it WAS a challenge! 

Done!
